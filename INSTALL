Text Critter 0.80 Install 
-------------------------

This program was written using Linux with Perl 5.005 and PerlTk
800.14.  If you don't have these installed, please see below.

1.  Unpack the distribution archive in the directory of your 
choice; e.g.:

# tar zxvf critter-0.83.tar.gz

This will create the subdirectory critter-0.83, which contains
the critter program, data files, and miscellaney.  

2.  If you are root, you can copy the executable to a directory
    in the system's search path, like /usr/local/bin, and the files 
    critter.help, critter.prefs, and spider.xbm to the directory 
    /usr/local/lib/critter so that all users will have access to them; 
    e.g.;

       cd critter-0.83
       mkdir /usr/local/lib/critter
       cp critter /usr/local/bin
       cp critter.help critter.prefs spider.xbm /usr/local/lib/critter
       cp critter.1 /usr/local/man/man1

    If you are not root, you can install these files in under 
    your $HOME directory in the subdirectory .critter.  This directory
    will not be visible in normal listings.  E.g.;

       cd critter-0.87
       mkdir ~/.critter
       cp critter.help critter.prefs spider.xbm "/.critter
   
    The program will still work without these files installed,
    but you will not have on-line help or the cute spider on the
    main window display.  The program will still save your preferences
    in ~/.critter, however, creating the ~/.critter directory if 
    necessary.

3.  That should be all.  In an xterm, enter:

./critter &  # If critter is installed in one of your $HOME directories,
	     # or simply,

critter &    # If it is installed in one of the directories in your 
             # search path.

If you find it isn't working, you can enable error logging to the 
terminal by default by changing the $log_default value at line 167
from 0 to 1.  Then the program will output copious amounts of 
information to the terminal.

If the shell says "file not found," that probably means the program
can't locate Perl on your system.  Edit the first line of the program
with the path name of your system's perl interpreter (i.e., the output
of "which perl").

Where to Find Perl and Tcl/Tk:
------------------------------

If you don't have Perl or the PerlTk package, you can find them
on http://www.cpan.org/.  Follow the instructions in the
distributions to install them.  Tcl/Tk is available from 
http://www.tclconsortium.org/.
