Text Critter 0.88 Installation
------------------------------

This program was written using Linux with Perl 5.005 and PerlTk
800.14.  If you don't have these installed, please see below.

1.  Unpack the tar file:

      $ tar zxvf critter-0.88.tar.gz

    This will create the subdirectory critter-0.88, which contains
    the critter program, data files, and miscellaney.  

2.  If you are root, you can copy the executable to a directory
    in the system's search path, like /usr/local/bin, and the files 
    critter.help and critter.prefs the directory /usr/local/lib/critter 
    so that all users will have access to them, e.g.;

       # cd critter-0.88
       # mkdir /usr/local/lib/critter
       # cp critter /usr/local/bin
       # cp critter.help critter.prefs /usr/local/lib/critter
       # cp critter.1 /usr/local/man/man1

    If you are not root, you can install these files in your $HOME
    directory in the subdirectory .critter.  This directory will 
    not be visible in normal listings.  E.g.;

       $ cd critter-0.88
       $ mkdir ~/.critter
       $ cp critter.help critter.prefs ~/.critter
   
    The program will still work without these files installed,
    but you will not have on-line help.  The program will still save
    your preferences in ~/.critter, however, and will create the 
    ~/.critter directory if necessary.

3.  That should be all.  In an xterm, enter:

      $ ./critter &  # If critter is installed in your $HOME directory,
      $ critter &    # If installed in a directory in the search path.

If you find the program isn't working, you can enable error logging to
the terminal by default by changing the $log_default value at line 152
from 0 to 1.  Then the program will output copious amounts of
information to the terminal.

If the shell says "file not found," that probably means the program
can't locate Perl on your system.  Edit the first line of the program
with the path name of your system's Perl interpreter (i.e., the output
of "which perl").
